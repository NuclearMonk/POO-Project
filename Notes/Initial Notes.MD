# Game Modes
There are two gamemodes
1. Debug Mode
2. Simulation Mode

## Debug Mode
To start debug mode the program may receive the following data  
1. credit -> The Player's Initial money balance.
2. cmd-file -> The name/path of the file with the commands
3. card-file -> The file that contains an ordered set of cards from which the hand must be played from

## Simulation Mode
For a simulation the program may receive 3 parameters
1. credit -> The Player's initial money balance
2. bet -> The value to bet during all simulations
3. nbdeals-> The total number of deals that the simulation will run

The algorithm for perfect play is detailed in Section 2 of the pdf
During a simulation some logs with statistics should be printed


## The Pay Table
The pay table is the one in the section 1.3 of the pdf
